# Question 3
Develop an ML model to predict diabetes(last column in the datset) from the
pima Indians dataset using Logistic Regression. This dataset is from the
National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The
objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient
has diabetes. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these
instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females
at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage (pimaindians.csv )

Split the data as train and test sets before developing the model. Plot the actual
and predicted points for test data. Obtain mean squared error & RMSE value
